# BCSTANDARDS — garthpuckerin

> AI agents: read this before writing code. This is the AI Context Contract for this repo.

## Governance

- Authority: **Blurred Concepts Engineering Constitution v2.0** — `github.com/garthpuckerin/blurred-concepts-engineering` (local: `D:\BlurredConcepts\blurred-concepts-engineering`).
- Standards library: `blurred-concepts-engineering/standards/`.
- Precedence (Constitution §1): direct owner instruction → this `BCSTANDARDS.md` → Constitution → topic standards → supporting docs.
- This file was seeded fleet-wide on 2026-07-17; tailor repo-specific sections (product class, CI, context) as the repo is worked on.

## Code Comprehension (Comprehension Ladder Standard)
<!-- bcstd:managed comprehension v1 -->
- Graph repo_id: `github.com/garthpuckerin/garthpuckerin`
- Ladder-first: query the mimir2-graph MCP ladder (`map` / `find` / `explain` /
  `neighbors` / `read`) with the repo_id above BEFORE raw file reads or grep
  for structure/behavior/relationship questions. Raw reads remain correct for
  editing, ungraphed repos, non-code content, and exact-line verification.
  Canonical text: `standards/Comprehension_Ladder_Standard.md` in
  blurred-concepts-engineering — it governs on any conflict.
<!-- /bcstd:managed -->

## Institutional Memory
<!-- bcstd:managed memory v1 -->
- The comprehension and memory habits are active client bindings, not passive
  repository guidance. Each client must use the highest enforcement tier it
  supports under the Comprehension Ladder Standard.
- Recall Ogham with `hybrid_search` when starting work on a system that may
  have prior context. Before ending, store decisions with rationale, gotchas,
  and cross-session operational context with source, controlled tags, and a
  deliberate TTL. Never store secrets or code-structure facts.
- Canonical memory policy: `standards/Memory_Standard.md` in
  blurred-concepts-engineering — it governs on any conflict.
